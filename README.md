# Notes

Personal notes on various topics, including programming, mathematics,
history, philosofy, literature, etc.

This repository is written in multiple languages because i speak more than
one also, and i'm too lazy to translate the stuff i put in here. So if you
want to read everything (which i think is probably not the case), translate
it by yourself.
